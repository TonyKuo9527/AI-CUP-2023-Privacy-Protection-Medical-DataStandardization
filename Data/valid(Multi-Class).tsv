Dear Xander,	Xander	1
I am not certain of the diagnosis.Possibilities I considered were a well differentiated liposarcoma with myxoid areas, an unusual myxoid liposarcoma, a chondroid lipoma, a cellular myxoma and a low grade fibro myxoid sarcoma. The negative MUC4 immunostain is against thelatter. The absence of MDM2 amplification on FISH (please see Prof K'Eberling comment below) is against a well differentiated liposarcoma. Further FISH analysis (DDIT3 & FUS) is pending.	K'Eberling	1

Prof Erasmo Greenwaldt comments:	Erasmo Greenwaldt	1
I agree with Prof Kirby report. I do not have a definite diagnosis for this low grade fibro myxoid tumour.	Kirby	1
A/Prof DEON BALCKWELL comments:	DEON BALCKWELL	1
I agree with Prof Tarka differential for this most unusual myoid tumour. Whilst it is not typical of any of them, I slightly favour an unusual chondroid lipoma but definitely could not exclude a low grade sarcoma. I await FISH analysis results with interest.	Tarka	1
Dr Brittaney Farr comments:	Brittaney Farr	1
I agree that this very myxoid neoplasm is difficult to characterise but I think that there are features that are concerning for a myxoid liposarcoma (areas of delicate arborising vessels), "lymphangioma" like spaces secondary to pools of mucin, and agree that FISH for evidence of re-arrangement of DDIT3 might be helpful (as requested by Dr Kolkowski).

The slides were reviewed by Dr PEARL Beskom, Dr U Stauss, Dr U Sandhaus and myself without a definite consensus diagnosis being reached. The positive neurofilament stain (NF6S), however, would support a cellular neurofibroma with atypia. The mitoses, up to 3mm/2. would support low grade malignancy for this tumour which is composed of poorly defined bundles of small spindle cells. The proliferation index - up to 10% nuclei positive with Ki67 could also fit a low grade malignancy.	PEARL Beskom	1

I favour a diagnosis of intramuscular lipoma rather than atypical lipomatous tumour.  A tissue block will be sent to WARIALDA MULTIPURPOSE SERVICE's Hospital for FISH to look for MDM2 amplification; such amplification is identifiable in most atypical lipomatous tumours/ well differentiated lipoma-like liposarcomas, but is absent in benign tumours (Sirvent et al.

Following presentation at the Colorectal Meeting by Dr J Warntz, the recent past history of a rectal carcinoid tumour was realised. In view of this, neuroendocrine markers were performed on the solitary lymph node metastasis and these were found to be positive, consistent with metastaticcarcinoid tumour (low grade neuroendocrine tumour) rather than rectal adenocarcinoma.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (14.4.64):	14.4.64	13
The histology of the previous right parietal tumour (20S65987) has been reviewed and further reticulin and GFAP stains have been performed.  The previous tumour lacks the spindle cell appearance of the present tumour and reticulin is only around blood vessels, not individual cells.  Also, it is generally GFAP positive.  The previous tumour is still considered to be a glioblastoma (WHO grade 4); no sarcomatous component is identified.	20S65987	20

LEFT AXILLARY LYMPH NODE: MALIGNANT SPINDLE CELL TUMOUR FAVOURING METASTATIC MELANOMA". (End of Dr Violette's report).	Violette	1
With the further history obtained that there was an atypical pigmented lesion removed from the left arm in December 2061, I agree that it seems that the diagnosis is most likely to be metastatic malignant melanoma	December 2061	13

The slides were also reviewed at GATTON HOSPITAL by Prof K Cokel and Dr K Sobran.  They also agree that metastatic melanoma is the most likely diagnosis.  They also reviewed the slides of the previousskin excision (KZ-95-13136).  They comment that there are some atypical spindle cells and that it could represent the primary, however they do not think that there is enough evidence for a definite diagnosis on the limited suboptimal material that is available for assessment.

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr K Sharr):	K Sharr	1
Sections show a single deposit of a high grade spindle cell tumour showing occasional marked nuclear pleomorphism, abundant mitoses and areas of geographical necrosis.  The tumour cells show strong positive staining with S100 and moderate positive staining with Fascin.  The PanCK, HMB45 and Melan A stains are negative.  The tumour has the same morphological appearance and immunohistochemical profile to the previously reported metastatic melanoma within a left axillary lymph node (44D49574).	44D49574	20

C.  Sections show a circumscribed deposit of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with luminal necrosis.  The appearance of the tumour is similar to the previous lung resection (23A09702) and is consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma from a colorectal primary.  The tumour does not breech the pleural surface and comes to within 2mm of the surgical resection margin.  The remaining lung parenchyma shows no significant abnormality.	23A09702	20

Although the tumour cells have very similar morphology that seen in the previously diagnosed high grade urothelial carcinoma (L7 CONSULTING ROOMS: Q11478963), the immunohistochemical profile is different.  The urothelial carcinoma shows positive staining with CK7 and CK20, plus focal staining with CK5/6.  The CA125 stain is negative.	L7 CONSULTING ROOMS	3
