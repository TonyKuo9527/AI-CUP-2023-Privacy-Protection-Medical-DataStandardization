Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]

The appearance of the uterine tumour, together with the immunoprofile (Vimentin positive, ER positive, CEA only patchy positive and p16 only patchy, rather than strongly and diffusely, positive) indicates that this is a primary endometrial rather than endocervical carcinoma.  Endometrioid adenocarcinoma of the lower segment is associated with Lynch syndrome.	invalid[@]

Given the depth of invasion of the endometrioidtumour, and the histologic similarity, this may well be a metastasis from the endometrium rather than a separate primary.	invalid[@]

Sections of the uterine tumour show a Grade 1 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. The adenocarcinoma consists predominantly of complex, crowded glands, some of which have a cribriform morphology, lined by moderately pleomorphic carcinoma cells (FIGO architecture grade 1; nuclear grade 2 = overall grade 1). The carcinoma extends 2.2mm into a uterine wall 12mm thick. There is no evidence of lymphovascular space invasion. The carcinoma does not involve the sampled uterine cornua.	invalid[@]
The non-neoplastic endometrium shows patchy atypical complex endometrial hyperplasia. There iswidespread adenomyosis and scattered benign leiomyomas. The uterine cervix, bilateral fallopian tubes and ovaries show no significant abnormality.	invalid[@]

Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]

"Thank you for the opportunity to see the slides from this case.	invalid[@]
As you know large adrenal cortical lesions with oncocytic cytologic features are a very problematic and evolving area in pathology. It is clear that theWeiss criteria cannot be applied without modification to oncocytic lesions, therefore other systems such as the Lin-Weiss-Bisceglia system (LWB) have been proposed as has the reticulin algorithm. The reason why so many systems have been proposed is that none have been proven to be completely sensitive and specific.	invalid[@]
We have performed additional Immunohistochemistry which is as follows;	invalid[@]
Glucocorticoid receptor: Diffuse strong nuclear expression (glucocorticoid score 4+)	invalid[@]
IGF2: Positive (perinuclear dot-like pattern)	invalid[@]
Therefore on the basis of the very large size of the tumour, the presence of myxoid and pseudoglandular change, and the presence of strong positive staining for both IGF2 and glucocorticoid receptor, I favour this as adrenal cortical carcinoma of myxoid and oncocytic type.	invalid[@]
I emphasise that the mitotic rate is low as is the Ki67 proliferative index (<1%). Therefore the tumour is classified as low-grade.	invalid[@]

MICROSCOPIC REPORT	invalid[@]
Dear Xander,	Xander[@]
The excision specimen of this low grade myxoid lesion remains difficult. I am still uncertain how to classify this hypo-cellular fibro myxoid lesion within fatty tissue. It is essentially circumscribed and includes hyalinised collagenous areas with scattered non atypical spindle shaped cells and interspersed myxoid areas.	invalid[@]
Within the latter are spindle shaped cells but focally are some multi vacuolated lipoblast-like cells. There is some form of vascularity in thestroma but this is not uniform as it typically seen in myxoid liposarcomas.	invalid[@]
Our immunostains show some positivity for S100. Immunostains for Muc-4 and EMA appear negative.	invalid[@]
I am not certain of the diagnosis.Possibilities I considered were a well differentiated liposarcoma with myxoid areas, an unusual myxoid liposarcoma, a chondroid lipoma, a cellular myxoma and a low grade fibro myxoid sarcoma. The negative MUC4 immunostain is against thelatter. The absence of MDM2 amplification on FISH (please see Prof K'Eberling comment below) is against a well differentiated liposarcoma. Further FISH analysis (DDIT3 & FUS) is pending.	K'Eberling[@]
Kind regards,	invalid[@]
Yours sincerely	invalid[@]

A/Prof DEON BALCKWELL comments:	DEON BALCKWELL[@]
I agree with Prof Tarka differential for this most unusual myoid tumour. Whilst it is not typical of any of them, I slightly favour an unusual chondroid lipoma but definitely could not exclude a low grade sarcoma. I await FISH analysis results with interest.	Tarka[@]
Dr Brittaney Farr comments:	Brittaney Farr[@]
I agree that this very myxoid neoplasm is difficult to characterise but I think that there are features that are concerning for a myxoid liposarcoma (areas of delicate arborising vessels), "lymphangioma" like spaces secondary to pools of mucin, and agree that FISH for evidence of re-arrangement of DDIT3 might be helpful (as requested by Dr Kolkowski).

However, double minute chromosomes were observed, which is a cytogenetic hallmark of gene amplification. FISH for MDM2 showed a signal pattern, consistent with amplified MDM2. This is a feature of well-differentiated/dedifferentiated liposarcoma.

* Thisis intended as an adjunct to other prognostic and predictive factors to aid clinical treatment decisions.	invalid[@]
* This test detects the presence of KRAS gene mutations affecting codons 12/13 or 61 of the KRAS protein, but does not specifythe KRAS gene mutation detected. Other mutations, either in the KRAS gene or in other genes, will NOT be detected by this analysis.	invalid[@]
* This test has been shown in our laboratory to detect at least 5% mutant KRAS alleles in a background of normal DNA.	invalid[@]
* The analytical sensitivity and specificity of this test are 99.5% and 99%, respectively. PCR inhibitors or rare mutations affecting the binding sites of PCR primers used in this assay may cause a false negative result.	invalid[@]

The existence of ER -ve, PR +ve cancer has been disputed in the literature. Some authors suggest positive PR staining in this context may be due to non-specific binding by PR antibody (De Maeyer et al,, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Jan 10;26(2):335-6 and Hefti at al., Breast Cancer Research 2013, 15:R68).	invalid[@]

An abnormal clone with a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 2 and 14 was detected. Karyotypes with simple balanced translocations have been reported as a feature of some published haemangiopericytomas, but no recurrent translocation isdescribed. A breakpoint in 12q is a feature of some cases, but was not observed in this case. These results are consistent with, but not diagnostic for, haemangiopericytoma.	invalid[@]

The morphology and immunohistochemical profile are consistent with a neural tumour.  Thepossibilities include a solitary circumscribed neuroma (palisaded encapsulated neuroma) and schwannoma, although the very weak staining with S100 and increased mitotic activity are unusual.

The slides were reviewed by Dr PEARL Beskom, Dr U Stauss, Dr U Sandhaus and myself without a definite consensus diagnosis being reached. The positive neurofilament stain (NF6S), however, would support a cellular neurofibroma with atypia. The mitoses, up to 3mm/2. would support low grade malignancy for this tumour which is composed of poorly defined bundles of small spindle cells. The proliferation index - up to 10% nuclei positive with Ki67 could also fit a low grade malignancy.	PEARL Beskom[@]U Stauss[@]U Sandhaus[@]
Further stains - CD34, Factor 13a, Calponin and repeat S100 were suggested.	invalid[@]

History:	invalid[@]
57 year old man with a previous history of papillary carcinoma of the thyroid treated with resection and radiotherapy to the neck.  Now two separate intracerebral lesions, a complex enhancing lesion in the left posterior frontal periventricular white matter with surrounding oedema.  A second exophytic non-enhancing lesion in the corpus callosum protrudes from the genu into the right frontal horn.	57[@]
Macroscopic:	invalid[@]
Microscopic:	invalid[@]
B and D (Left periventricular frontal tumour).	invalid[@]
Multiple fragments of tumour consisting of moderately pleomorphic elongated cells, predominantly arranged in interweaving bundles.  Scattered cells with nuclear pseudoinclusions are identified.  Mitoses are easily found and the Ki-67 labelling index is approximately 20-30%.  Foci of necrosis are present and there is prominent microvascular proliferation.  Compared to the right frontal tumour (see below) this lesion is more cellular and the cells more uniform and less pleomorphic.	invalid[@]
Special stains demonstrate perivascular reticulin only and highlight the microvascular proliferation.  The tumour cells are strongly Vimentin positive and many are also GFAP positive.	invalid[@]
There is moderate granular membranous and some cytoplasmic MIC2 staining. CD34 stains endothelial cells.  There is a small amount of focal patchy interstitial staining, although this is much less prominent than in the contralateral lesion (see:below).  Scattered strongly p53 : positive cells are noted, probably <5%. Compared to the contralateral lesion there are also more numerous weakly staining cells.	invalid[@]
The majority ofthe tumour cells are negative for EMA although very rare cells, especially at periphery of several tissue fragments contain an EMA-positive paranuclear dot.  Stains for NeuN, chromogranin, synaptophysin, pancytokeratin, IDH1 RI25H and TTFI are negative.	invalid[@]
A and C (Right frontal corpus callosum tumour):	invalid[@]
The permanent sections consist of multiple pieces of tissue including fragments of normal cerebral cortex and fragments of solid tumour.	invalid[@]
In some areas the interstitium is finely vacuolated and slightly basophilic, suggesting mucin.  There are scattered micro-cysts and very rare calcospherites.  No Rosenthal fibres or eosinophilic granular bodies are identified with haematoxylin and eosin. No ependyma is identified.	invalid[@]
Perivascular chronic inflammatory cells are noted, often surrounding veins with some adventitial fibrosis.  There is no vascular proliferation or necrosis and mitotic figures are not identified.  The Ki67 labelling index is low (visually estimated at approximately 2%).	invalid[@]
Although in one fragment the tumour appears to be well demarcated from the surrounding dense paucicellular fibrillary gliosis, neurofilament antibodies highlight prominent axons bundles traversing the tumour.  These are accentuated adjacent to vessels.  In some areas beaded axons and axonalspheroids are also noted.	invalid[@]
Special stains demonstrate perivascular reticulin only.  The GFAP staining is generally pale and most of the tumour cells do not show cytoplasmic immunoreactivity adjacent to the nucleus, although scattered GFAP positive processes are noted, especially adjacent to vessels.  These processes do not radiate towards the vessels as seen in ependymal perivascular pseudorosettes.	invalid[@]
NeuN identifies normal neurons in cortical fragments but not tumour cells. lmmunostains for synaptophysin, IDH R125H, chromogranin, pancytokeratin and TTFI are negative.  MIC2 (CD99) is also negative although there is high background staining.	invalid[@]
FISH analysis (Dr R Maltez, CLONCURRY MULTI-PURPOSE HEALTH SERVICE's Hospital) on the right frontal tumour was negative for lp/19q loss although polysomy for Ip and 19q was demonstrated.  There was no EGFR amplification.	R Maltez[@]CLONCURRY MULTI-PURPOSE HEALTH SERVICE[@]

Diagnosis:	invalid[@]
Left frontal tumour:  GLIOBLASTOMA (WHO GRADE IV)	invalid[@]
Right frontal tumour:  DIFFUSE ASTROCYTOMA (WHO GRADE II; see Comment)	invalid[@]
Comment:	invalid[@]
The right frontal lesion is a low grade glioma without high grade features and is best classified as a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II).  However, a number of unusual morphological findings are noted, including the very limited GFAP staining and the strong CD34 immunoreactivity, that are not typical of most WHO grade II diffuse astrocytomas.	invalid[@]
Although limited or absent GFAP staining is described in some subependymal giant cell astrocytomas, there are no other features supporting this diagnosis.  Similarly, although CD34 immunoreactivity is a feature of many glioneuronal tumours and of pleomorphic xanthoastrocytomas, the other morphologicaland immunohistochemical findings in this case do not support these diagnoses.	invalid[@]
The relationship between the left and the right frontal lesions is uncertain.  Although they are radiologically and morphologically distinct, suggesting separate lesions, the possibility of microscopic continuity or a common origin cannot be entirely excluded. FISH analysis to assess Ip and 19q polysomy and EGFR amplification will be performed on the left frontal glioblastoma.  If clinically indicated, further genetic analysis may be helpful.	invalid[@]
This case was reviewed by Dr Arie Perry (Director of Neuropathology, UCSF) who agreed that the left frontal lesion is a glioblastoma (WHO grade IV).  He also agreed that the right frontal tumour is unusual but considered that the features were those of a low grade tumour, best classified as a diffuse astrocytoma (WHO grade II).	invalid[@]
commented that he had also seen low grade astrocytomas with limited GFAP immunoreactivity.  He suggested that further immunostaining for other glial markers,	invalid[@]
including Olig-2, Sox-2 and S100, might-be helpful.	invalid[@]

The sections of the smaller nodules show metastatic fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma forming a nodule, consistent with metastatic tumour completely replacing a lymph node with a small amount of perinodal spread.  Areas of necrosis are present in the tumour.  The tumour focally abuts the margins of the specimen.  There is another lymph node with reactive features only.	invalid[@]
The larger mass shows fibrolamellar carcinoma occupying mostof the specimen, with large areas of necrosis present.  The lesion focally abuts the margins of the specimen.	invalid[@]

Sections show a well circumscribed 60mm tumour consistent with a renal oncocytoma. The tumour is composed of relatively monomorphic cells with abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm arranged in nests, tubules and lining cystic spaces. Mitoses are not prominent.In some areas the rounded tumour cell nests are surrounded by loose myxoid stroma.	invalid[@]
The tumour abuts but does not invade the renal capsule.	invalid[@]
The ureteric and vascular resection margins are clear.	invalid[@]
The surrounding renal parenchyma shows patchy mild chronic interstitial inflammation and scattered sclerosed glomeruli, particularly around the edge of the tumour, possibly reflecting local compressive changes. Elsewhere the renal parenchyma appears unremarkable.	invalid[@]
The tumour is negative for Hale's colloidal iron staining. Immunoperoxidase staining is positive for CD117 and negative for CD10, CK7 and vimentin.	invalid[@]

A.  Sections show fibrofat with a deposit of grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma.	invalid[@]
B.  Sections of the cervix are unremarkable. Sections of the endometrial tumour show an endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  It is architectural grade 1 but has severe cytologic atypia, with large vesicular nuclei and prominent nucleoli, so is overall grade 2.  No definite myometrial invasion is seen.  No lymphovascular invasion is seen. There is no cervical involvement.  There are foci of adenomyosis in the myometrium and a leiomyoma is also confirmed in the myometrium.	invalid[@]
Sections of the left fallopian tube show that this is distended by a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with a papillary architecture.  This involves the mucosa and projects into the tube lumen.  Most of the lining epithelium of the tube is unremarkable, apart from being attenuated by the tube dilation.  The tubal tumour shows mucinous differentiation.  Sections of the left cornu show no connection between the endometrial tumour and the left tubal tumour.	invalid[@]
At the fimbrial end of the tube there is focal involvement of the surface epithelium by endometrioid adenocarcinoma.  Sectionsfrom the right and left parametrial soft tissue show occasional small subserosal deposits of metastatic endometrioid adenocarcinoma.	invalid[@]

AMMENDED REPORT: (A/Prof J Magos 21/4/64)	J Magos[@]21/4/64[@]
Following presentation at the Colorectal Meeting by Dr J Warntz, the recent past history of a rectal carcinoid tumour was realised. In view of this, neuroendocrine markers were performed on the solitary lymph node metastasis and these were found to be positive, consistent with metastaticcarcinoid tumour (low grade neuroendocrine tumour) rather than rectal adenocarcinoma.	J Warntz[@]
The staging of the current rectal adenocarcinoma is therefore classified as pN0.	invalid[@]
Dr J Panak has discussed this amendment to the staging with the clinical team.	J Panak[@]

The previous tumour lacks the spindle cell appearance of the present tumour and reticulin is only around blood vessels, not individual cells.  Also, it is generally GFAP positive.  The previous tumour is still considered to be a glioblastoma (WHO grade 4); no sarcomatous component is identified.	20S65987[@]

COMMENT:	invalid[@]
The morphologic and immunohistochemical features are consistent with a gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours less than 50mm in size and with a low mitotic rate (less than 5/50hpf), are typically associated with a low risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM).	invalid[@]

Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]

The resection margins of the small intestine appear viable, with no evidence of malignancy.  Elsewhere, the small intestine shows serosal surface deposits of a malignant spindle cell tumour.  The tumour has plumpspindled cells with frequent large bizarre nuclei, and frequent mitotic figures, many of which are atypical.  There is extensive haemorrhage within the tumour.	invalid[@]
The separate tissue pieces of pale tumour show similar features to that described in the small and large bowel.  Focal tumour necrosis is noted.  Immunohistochemical stains for keratins Cam5.2, CK7, CK20 and CK5/6 are negative, Other negative stains include Desmin, Smooth Muscle Actin, S100, HMB-45, Melan A, Factor VIII, CD31, CD34, and CD117. The features are those of a high-grade pleomorphic sarcoma. Correlation with clinical history and any previous pathology reports is recommended.	invalid[@]

The appearances are interpreted as a high grade sarcoma in a lymph node.  It stains S100 and Fascin positive and also shows some patchy CD68 positivity.  I favour this being a primary nodal sarcoma and the immunophenotype fits best with an interdigitating dendritic cell sarcoma.  These are very rare tumours which most commonly present with solitary lymph node involvement.  The clinical course is said to be generally aggressive.	invalid[@]

With the further history obtained that there was an atypical pigmented lesion removed from the left arm in December 2061, I agree that it seems that the diagnosis is most likely to be metastatic malignant melanoma	December 2061[@]

The slides were also reviewed at GATTON HOSPITAL by Prof K Cokel and Dr K Sobran.  They also agree that metastatic melanoma is the most likely diagnosis.  They also reviewed the slides of the previousskin excision (KZ-95-13136).  They comment that there are some atypical spindle cells and that it could represent the primary, however they do not think that there is enough evidence for a definite diagnosis on the limited suboptimal material that is available for assessment.

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr I Hodgdon):	I Hodgdon[@]
Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal transverse colon.  The tumour is almost circumferential and no residual adenoma is identified.  The carcinoma appears obstructive and has resulting in proximal dilatation. There is no evidence of ischaemic mucosal changesproximally and the mucosa of the colon shows a mild/moderate melanosis coli.	invalid[@]
The carcinoma has extended through the full thickness of the bowel wall and shows prominent infiltration of the transverse mesocolon. The tumour also shows involvement of the peritoneum where small glands are seen on the surface of the mesothelium and this peritoneal surface (antimesenteric) appears mildly inflamed.	invalid[@]
A total of forty-four (44) lymph nodes are identified (nine lymph nodes adjacent to the tumour, twenty-three proximal nodes and twelve distal nodes).  A single node immediately distal to the tumour is largely replaced by metastatic adenocarcinoma with mild perinodalspread.  No other lymph nodes are involved.	invalid[@]
The resection includes a total of nine (9) tubular adenomas both proximal and distal to the carcinoma and there is no evidence of metastatic spread tothe attached omentum.  The distal ileum and appendix show no abnormality.	invalid[@]

Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instabilityphenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood ofmicrosatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]

A.  Sections show moderately differentiated serous carcinoma involving the fimbrial ends of both fallopian tubes; the involvement is more prominent of the right side, where the deposit measures 9mm in diameter.  No carcinoma in-situ of the tubal epithelium is identified.There are also microscopic tumour deposits on the serosal surfaces of both fallopian tubes and both ovaries.  There is also focal extension of tumour from the serosa into the cortex of each ovary.  Vascular invasion is identified.	invalid[@]
There is a focus of endometriosis within the right fallopian tube wall.	invalid[@]
The cervix shows no significant abnormality.  The endometrium displays cystic atrophic features. The myometrium is unremarkable.  There are small foci ofserous carcinoma on, and just beneath, the serosal surface of the anterior uterus.	invalid[@]
B.  Sections confirm the presence of variable sized deposits of moderately differentiated serous carcinoma.

I favour a diagnosis of well differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma, rather than an adenoma, since the lesion has areas with thick trabeculae (>3 cells), focal loss of reticulin fibres, unaccompanied arteries and stromal invasion.  Focally there are a few pseudo glandular structures (dilated bile canaliculi).  Scattered mitotic figures arealso seen.  No vascular invasion is identified.	invalid[@]

Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation ofthat mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]

Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]

The morphologic and immunohistochemical features areconsistent with a gastro-intestinal stromal tumour (GIST). Although the behaviour of these tumours can be unpredictable, individual tumours between 50 and 100mm in size and with mitotic rate of 5/50hpf, are typically associated with a high risk of aggressive behaviour (7th edition of the AJCC/TNM).	invalid[@]

Sections show a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the caecum.  The tumour has infiltrated through the full thickness of the bowel wall and involves the serosa.  In one area the serosa is inflamed and haemorrhagic and it is debateable whether tumour cells have breached the serosa.  However in my view this layer has not definitely been breached by tumour (pT3).  The carcinoma also shows early invasion of the mesentery, and abuts the appendiceal orifice and ileocaecal valve.	invalid[@]
The appendix shows a small mucocele as a result of adenomatous epithelial lining (cystadenoma) rather than as a result of obstruction.	invalid[@]

Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]

MICROSCOPIC (reported by Dr Q Guill):	Q Guill[@]
COMMENT:	invalid[@]
Although the tumour cells have very similar morphology that seen in the previously diagnosed high grade urothelial carcinoma (L7 CONSULTING ROOMS: Q11478963), the immunohistochemical profile is different.  The urothelial carcinoma shows positive staining with CK7 and CK20, plus focal staining with CK5/6.  The CA125 stain is negative.	L7 CONSULTING ROOMS[@]Q11478963[@]
It is thus concluded that the current tumour may not represent a recurrence of urothelial carcinoma, but instead is favoured to represent a poorly differentiated mulleriancarcinoma.  As a normal ovary and fallopian tube are present, the tumour may be of peritoneal origin.	invalid[@]
B.  The ectocervix and endocervix show no significant abnormality.  The endometrium is inactive and contains a small benign endometrial polyp.  The myometrium, fallopian tubes and left ovary show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	invalid[@]
C.  Sections of the omentum show no significant abnormality.  There is no evidence of malignancy.	invalid[@]

Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]

A&B. Both specimens show similar features and consist of cerebellum infiltrated by sheets and cohesive nests of large cells with pleomorphic nuclei, prominent nucleoli, and moderate amount of eosinophilic cytoplasm. Mitotic activity is brisk and large areas of necrosis are present. While the overall appearance of the tumour is poorly differentiated,several foci of possible glandular differentiation are seen in the Diastase stain, consistent with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.	invalid[@]

Comment: The posterior fossa tumour is a metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma, favour adenocarcinoma. Melanoma and neuroendocrine markers are negative. PSA and TTF-1 negativity makes prostate and lung primaries unlikely, respectively.  CDX-2 is a marker of intestinal differentiation and can be seen in adenocarcinomas of GI tract, pancreas and biliary origin. CK7 positivity and CK20negativity makes an upper GI primary more likely.

A binary (low/high) grading scheme for pseudomyxoma peritonei of appendix origin,	invalid[@]
is recommended by WHO (2010). The current peritoneal tumour deposits show features of low grade pseudomyxoma peritonei, broadly equivalent todisseminated peritoneal adenomucinosis (DPAM) (Ronnett 2001). Current TNM recommends staging as peritoneal metastasis (pM1a).	invalid[@]

MICROSCOPIC:  (Reported by Dr D Tela):	D Tela[@]
A & B.  The sections of brain show sheets of highly atypical epithelial cells associated with abundant necrosis.  Islands of viable tumour cells are present in a perivascular location.  The tumour cells are arranged in solid sheets and there are so areas of pseudoglandular and papillary-like patterns.  There is marked nuclear pleomorphism and abundant mitoses, many of which are atypical.	invalid[@]
No intracytoplasmic pigment is identified and no squamous differentiation is seen.	invalid[@]
The tumour cells show strong positive staining for CAM 5.2 but are negative for GFAP, consistent with metastatic carcinoma.  There is also positive staining for Keratin 7 and Oestrogen receptor.  Progesterone receptor is negative and the Oestrogen receptor staining is weak and focal.  TTF-1, CEA, Keratin 20 and P63 are all negative.  The P63 stain shows positive nuclear staining in a minority of cells within the tumour.	invalid[@]
The histological appearances are consistent with metastatic poorly differentiated carcinoma.  The presence of Oestrogen receptor staining raises the possibility of origin from breast or female genital tract amongst other sites.  Staining for CA125 and WT1 have been performed and are negative.  The CA125 shows very focal staining of uncertain significance.	invalid[@]

MSH2: Positive staining present	invalid[@]
MSH6: Positive staining present	invalid[@]
Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	invalid[@]
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.	invalid[@]

Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	invalid[@]
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]

Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]

Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence (loss) of nuclear staining for any of the mismatch repair enzymes MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSI), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair gene.	invalid[@]
Preserved nuclear staining of a carcinoma for MLH1, PMS2, MSH2, and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]

SUMMARY PANCREATIC TUMOUR	invalid[@]
A-C	invalid[@]
Sections of the pancreas show a 60mm well differentiated adenocarcinoma involving the body and tail of the pancreas, arising in association with high grade pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN). The carcinoma cells are predominantly arranged in glands and tubules however  few foci of smaller clusters and single scattered pleomorphic cells are also seen. The tumour shows extensive perineural involvement as well as intravascular (A13) involvement and extrapancreatic spread.	invalid[@]
The carcinoma lies 0.2mm (A25,A32) from the anterior surface and 0.25mm (A4) from the posterior surface and extends to the pancreatic resection margin (A1 and A2). The surrounding pancreas appear largely atrophic with relative preservation of the islet cells and extensive firbrosis. The carcinoma invades the adjacent adrenal gland. Seven of thirty six pancreatic lymph nodes have metastatic carcinoma.	invalid[@]

CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS	invalid[@]
Patients with tumours harbouring mutations in KRAS or NRAS exons 2, 3 or 4 predict lack of response to anti-EGFR therapies such as cetuximab or panitumumab (Douillard et al NEJM 2013; 369:1023-34; Stintzing et al Hematol Oncol Clin North Am 2015; 1:43-60; Peeters et al Drugs 2015; 75:731-48).	invalid[@]
When considering an EGFR inhibitor for the treatment ofmCRC, there is no clear evidence that BRAF is a negative predictive marker.	invalid[@]
Data suggest that BRAF mutations are an indicator of poor prognosis in mCRC regardless of treatment.	invalid[@]
TEST DESCRIPTION	invalid[@]
The therascreen KRAS RGQ PCR Kit is intended to detect 7 mutations in codons 12 and 13 of the KRAS gene, namely c.34G&amp;gt;T (G12C); c.34G&amp;gt;C (G12R); c.34G&amp;gt;A (Gl2S); c.35G&amp;gt;C (G12A); c.35G&amp;gt;A (G12D);	invalid[@]

Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	invalid[@]

Sections show disseminated poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma with signet ring and intestinal differentiation involving adipose tissue attached to gallbladder, splenic capsule including involvement of a splenic hilar lymph node, serosa of separately submitted segments of small bowel and colonic segment including colonic wall and submucosa.	invalid[@]
Metastatic adenocarcinoma is also seen in separately submitted peritoneal fragments, omentum and subcutaneous tissues with overlying unremarkable skin. The gallbladder mucosa and wall show no focal abnormalities. The cystic duct lymph node is unremarkable. The colonic mucosa and small bowel mucosa show no focal abnormality. The splenic parenchyma is unremarkable.	invalid[@]
Sections through gastric body shows metastatic adenocarcinoma involving adipose tissue attached to serosa without involvement of gastric wall.	invalid[@]
COMMENT:	invalid[@]
In view of the large ileocaecal mass, this may represent the primary tumour although the morphology is unusual. Origin from upper GI tract is also possible. Clinicopathological correlation is recommended.	invalid[@]

Immunostains for MSI proteins (MACQUARIE WARD NORMANTON HOSPITAL; block: A8)	MACQUARIE WARD[@]NORMANTON HOSPITAL[@]
MLH1:   POSITIVE	invalid[@]
PMS2:  POSITIVE	invalid[@]
MSH2:  POSITIVE	invalid[@]
MSH6:  POSITIVE	invalid[@]
Comment:	invalid[@]
Absence of staining for either MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 or MSH6 is associated with microsatellite instability phenotype (MSH-H), and may reflect the presence of a germline mutation or somatic inactivation of that mismatch repair enzyme.	invalid[@]
Positive staining of a carcinoma for MLH1,  PMS2,  MSH2  and MSH6 indicates a low likelihood of microsatellite instability phenotype.	invalid[@]
The antibodies used are not fully characterised for routine diagnostic use. Results may be affected by storage and fixation of specimens, and should be interpreted in conjunction with other investigation, including MSI testing where possible.	invalid[@]
