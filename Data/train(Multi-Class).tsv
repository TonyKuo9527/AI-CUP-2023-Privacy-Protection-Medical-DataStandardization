A.  The tumour is a subcutaneous leiomyosarcoma which appears of a higher grade than that reported on the core biopsy (see 20G60877).  There are focal areas of necrosis but well below 50% (score 1).  The mitotic rate is focally very high particularly at the advancing edge and in these areas the count exceeds 20/10 HPF (score 3).  The tumour is therefore of grade 3 - total score 6 (tumour differentiation -2, mitoses count -3, tumour necrosis - 1).	20G60877	20

The features are consistent with metastatic unclassifiable spindle cell sarcoma.  Unclassifiable spindle cell sarcoma was the diagnosis made on review by Prof. LOWELL PICCIONI in 2060 for the original pelvic tumour ; a more specific diagnosis was not possible.  The minimal patchy cytoplasmic CD117 staining with background hepatocellular staining in this case, is regarded as a negative result, especially in the context of previous negative DOG1 staining on two separate occasions.

I have reported this case in consultation with Dr ISMAEL AGUILAR and Dr BOB MCKIE and am aware of the previous core biopsy and FNA reports (66Q82010, 66Q82010).  While the type 2 pneumocytes at the periphery of the subpleural scar are undoubtedly atypical the appearance falls short of atypical adenomatous hyperplasia.  The appearance favours reactive atypia.  The subpleural scar contains a necrotising granuloma and this may represent an old Ghon focus.	ISMAEL AGUILAR	1

The histological features are those of a lipoma with areas of infarction, fibrosis and calcification. No atypical features are seen in numerous levels.  Retroperitoneal lipomas are described, but this diagnosis should take into account cytogenetic testing (fresh tissue and paraffin block have been sent to BARADINE MULTI PURPOSE SERVICE's Pathology) and long term follow up.

The differential diagnoses considered include a spindle cell lipoma with focal pleomorphic lipoma areas and well differentiated liposarcoma.  The features are not those of a neurofibroma.  In view of the location and overall appearances a diagnosis of spindle cell lipoma is favoured, however I cannot entirely exclude a well differentiated liposarcoma.  Tissue will be sent to BARWON HEALTH - ASHLEY MANOR CAMPUS'sHospital for MDM2 analysis and a supplementary report will be issued.	BARWON HEALTH - ASHLEY MANOR CAMPUS	4

The 30mm right thyroid nodule is an encapsulated follicular nodule. Occasional follicles and clusters of follicular cells show atypical nuclear features, which raise the possibility ofan encapsulated follicular variant of papillary carcinoma. However, due to the focal nature of these nuclear changes and their uncertain significance, the case will be sent to A/Professor ARDEN KOOSMAN for his expert opinion, and a supplementary report will be issued.

The findings are of an atypical glandular proliferation. While the general consensus in the department favoured a bile duct hamartoma with reactive changes, some felt a well differentiated metastatic adenocarcinoma could not be excluded. Slides will be sent to Professor LUCAS WOODLING, EASTERN EYRE HEALTH AND AGED CARE - COWELL CAMPUS Hospital for an expert opinion.	LUCAS WOODLING	1

I agree with you and Haroun that the liver lesion biopsies in specimen A ("Liver lesion segment 4") is a benign bile duct proliferation.  In my opinion it is best classified as a biliary hamartoma (while the lesion in specimen B from segment 2 is a peribiliary gland hamartoma/bile duct adenoma).	Haroun	1

D. Sections show a lymph node with a 7 mm deposit of metastatic urothelial carcinoma, with focal glandular differentiation.  There are sheets and nests of tumour cells with focal glandular formation, reminiscent of the previous biopsy (02Z11504). The tumour cells are positive for CK7, and are negative for CK20 and PSA. There is no evidence of extranodal spread.	02Z11504	20

The uterine tumour is an endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma. Although the initial endometrial curettings (04K99930) showed a predominant solid pattern of growth (FIGO Grade 3), examination ofthe entire endometrium shows the tumour is composed predominantly of complex infiltrative cribriform glands. Overall, these findings are most consistent with a FIGO Grade 2 endometrioid endometrial adenocarcinoma (Architecture: grade 2 (5 - 50% solid growth); Cytology: grade 2).	04K99930	20

Large tumour in sigmoid mesentery.  Core biopsy: solitary fibrous tumour at NATHALIA DISTRICT HOSPITAL&amp;#8217;s.  Appendicectomy.	NATHALIA DISTRICT HOSPITAL	4
Blocks 1 &amp;#8211; LS complete distal tip; 2 &amp;#8211; LS complete proximal end; 3-5 &amp;#8211; TS remaining appendix. Entire appendix embedded.     (TO: JB/ec 25.5.66)	25.5.66	13
MICROSCOPIC:  (REPORTED BY DR D Luskin)	D Luskin	1
Immunohistochemical stains were performed on the previously reported tumour core biopsy (INTENSIVE CARE UNIT S-16-02914) (CD99 and STAT 6+) and were not repeated.	INTENSIVE CARE UNIT	3
Overall, the morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical staining identified at RECOVERY is consistent with the diagnosis of solitary fibrous tumour. The clinical behaviour of solitary fibrous tumours may be unpredictable, however, the large size, increased cellularity, high mitotic rate (&amp;gt; 4/10 hpf) and presence of necrosis, portends more aggressive (malignant) behaviour in this case.

The features favour a minimally invasive follicular carcinoma (capsule invasion only).    I do not think there is evidence of vascular invasion despite the close approximation of tumour cells to the walls of intracapsular vessels.  I will seek a second opinion from Prof V Schoenhard at PORT MACQUARIE BASE HOSPITAL Hospital and a supplementary report will be issued.	V Schoenhard	1

The repeat MSH6 stain (received courtesy of TRANGIE MULTI PURPOSE HEALTH SERVICE Hospital) confirms abnormal loss of expression.   There is some non-specific cytoplasmic staining within the papilliform tumour within vascular spaces however nuclear expression appears either significantly reduced or lost.  This result supports the interpretation that the tumour is an endometrioid carcinoma. As the tumour has a microsatellite instability phenotype follow up of this result is advised.

C.  After discussion and viewing of the sections with Prof H Just, further levels of the most distal block of the posterior vagina/introitus have been cut (block C16).  There is focal tumour present in subepithelial tissue in these further levels, and this tumour persists in the levels until the tissue is extinguished.  It is therefore considered that there is tumour present very focally at the posterior introital margin.	H Just	1

The anatomy of the bile duct, pancreatic duct and intra-pancreatic branch ducts has been challenging to map due to the presence of widespread ductal dilatation and proliferative PanIN changes in many areas and due to the angle of sectioning employed to optimise examination of the portal vein.	U Wesche	1
The uncinate margin was discussed with Dr Kuhnen and is clear. The superior mesenteric artery (uncinate) margin neural plexus is described above.	Kuhnen	1

The appearances are favoured to be those of a malignant solitary fibrous tumour.  Slides will be sent to MILTON ULLADULLA HOSPITAL Hospital for a STAT 6 immunostain and a supplementary report issued.  If the STAT 6 stain is negative then the tumour is best regarded as an undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (malignant fibrous histiocytoma).	MILTON ULLADULLA HOSPITAL	4

As reported in the previous biopsy by Professor Jaussen, there is an associated peri-aortic high grade malignant sarcoma, which may represent: (a) malignant transformation arising within the previously treated para-aortic tumour; (b) or, a de novo sarcoma. In these specimens, the high grade sarcoma demonstrates malignant vasoformative morphology, as well as, strong diffuse staining with endothelial markers, consistent with a high grade angiosarcoma.

SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT (6.9.63, Dr A Santamarina):	A Santamarina	1
A.  Concern was raised at the Gynaecologic Oncology Meeting on 3.9.63 about the nature of a nodule on a fold of peritoneum between the bladder and cervix, which had not been sectioned.  The specimen was therefore re-examined.  A mucoid nodule around 10mm diameter was identified in the flap of peritoneum on the anterior endocervix, left side, and sections were taken (blocks A23 - A28).  The sections show only oedematous and inflammatory tissue with suture material from previous surgery; no tumour is seen.	3.9.63	13

Additional clinical information:  ?SCC cervix (see 87D09067)	87D09067	20
The previous cervical biopsy (87D09067) has been reviewed again and compared to the current ovarian tumour.  The previous cervical biopsy has no resemblance to the current serous carcinoma: it is a poorly differentiated carcinoma, arranged in solid sheets, with no glandular differentiation.  Whilst it's morphology is more squamous than adenocarcinoma, it is possible that it may represent endometrioid or transitional differentiation of the same ovarian tumour.	87D09067	20

A. The sections show dura with areas of moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, showing glands lined by moderately pleomorphic cells, with some mucinous features. Mitoses are readily found including atypical forms.  Dystrophic calcification is seen.  The slides have been compared with the previous specimen (42J34473) and the morphological features are similar, consistent with recurrence of the previous adenocarcinoma in the dura.	42J34473	20

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by Dr U Haughton):	U Haughton	1
The tumour is generally less cellular than the previous core biopsy (78T09670), and is composed of scattered tumour cells with a bizarre nuclearmorphology, against a myxoid background. The bizarre cells have markedly enlarged nuclei with irregular nuclear contours, macronucleoli and nuclear inclusions. There is < 1 mitosis per 10 hpf.	78T09670	20

Please note: Discrepancy about tumour location (right vs left).  The current request form states right breast but the specimen containers are labelled left breast.  The previous histology report (05X26478) also states left breast.  All notes are changes to left breast and please correlate.	05X26478	20

The histology of the previous endometrial carcinoma (63D37610) have been reviewed.This is confirmed to be a grade 1 endometrioid adenocarcinoma with no myometrial invasion.  The present tumour has more of a solid component, and higher grade cytology, than the previous one.  It still seems most likely that the presenttumour is metastatic from the previous one, however this is a very unusual situation.	63D37610	20

There are multiple fragments of peritoneum and fat measuring 20-220mm in maximum dimension. These pieces are studded with haemorrhage and mucin deposits spanning multiple large areas, especially over the largest fragment of peritoneum.  (18-20 representative peritoneum with tumour [block 20 tumour reserve block]). RS (M-20/TC/cy)	TC	1
The tumours of this type would generally originate from an appendiceal low grade mucinous neoplasm. Previous report from 11/7/2063 is noted (appx LAMN and DPAM). Correlation with previous operative findings recommended.	11/7/2063	13

There are several features which do not fit for adamantinomatous craniopharyngioma in this case, including the lack of wet keratin, the only focal calcification, the demonstration of some mucous containing goblet cells, and the lack of a surrounding xanthomatous tissue reaction.  Also, there is no aberrant nuclear staining for beta catenin and there is now positive BRAF staining.	now	13

MICROSCOPIC (Reported by A/Prof E Dannenberg):	E Dannenberg	1
The tumour is difficult to classify as there are overlapping morphological features between a low grade astrocytoma, WHO grade 2 and a low grade oligodendroglioma,WHO grade 2. The previous pathology was reviewed (14B35141). In the previous biopsy, the reporting pathologist also noted that morphologically the tumour was difficult to classify and in his opinion the features favoured a diagnosis of oligodendroglioma. There was no evidence of 1p/19q co-deletion in previous testing.	14B35141	20
I have reviewed this case with Drs E Lewan and E Vaquero and the consensus opinion is that the current biopsy is consistent with a recurrent low grade glioma and the features favour a diagnosis of astrocytoma, WHO grade 2.	E Lewan	1

The 53mm paraspinal lesion shows features consistent with recurrent sarcoma. The morphology and pattern of immunohistochemical staining is similar to that the previously reportedcore biopsy (65A34682) and would be in keeping with a (pleomorphic) leiomyosarcoma.The tumour shows high grade cytologic atypia (tumour differentiation score = 3), however, formal histologic grading was not performed as it may be unreliable after neoadjuvant therapy.	65A34682	20

The mass is partly surrounded by a thin fibrous capsule but it appears to extend to part of the inked excision margin (eg blocks 3, 3).  Tumour is seen extending into skeletal muscle, between muscle bundles, in one area near the edge (block 3).	3	20
